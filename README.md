Rook now all but done except for promotions. Will do later.

need to figure out check and checkmating system.

didn't need a neighbour king method, fark. Cause you need a "can't move into check method anyway", so you've doubled up...

my possible moves is looping to cant move into check which is looping back to possible move indefinitely, need to figure out a soloution.. taking into account both kings?
